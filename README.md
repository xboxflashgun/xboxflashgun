- 👋 Hi, I’m @xboxflashgun, and this is my pet project.
- 👀 I’m interested in Xbox video games, but I don't play it. I'm gathering gamers' playing statistics and trying to analyze it.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning perl, postgresql, php, ecma, d3.js
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on d3.js and visualization
- 📫 How to reach me: flashgun@xboxstat.ru
- ⚡ Fun fact: I've got a bald cat named Shrimpy
